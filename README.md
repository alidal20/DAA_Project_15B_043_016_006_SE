# Project Description
Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or replacements required to convert one string into another. This program calculates number of operarions (i.e insert, remove, replace) to be performed to convert string 1 to string 2.
