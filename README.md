# Project Description
Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or replacements required to convert one string into another.

# How to Run
To run this program create a C# Console Application Project on Visual Studio. Then open Program.cs file in Edit Distance folder and copy its content and paste in the project in C# Project. Now run it. It will ask for two inputs (i.e String 1 and String 2) and program will compute number of operations to convert string 1 to string 2.
